# Online Ticketing System

## Tools Used: (enter when you use them here)
1. MySQL workbench
2. DataGrip
## Instructions:
You are asked to create a database structure for online ticketing system (OTS) that sells movie tickets. The functional requirements of the system are listed below:
- [ ] The system should be able to list cities where its cinemas are located.
- [ ] Each city displays a number of movies released in that particular city.
- [ ] Once the user makes their movie choice, the system displays multiple cinemas with available show times.
- [ ] The user should be able to select the show from a cinema and book their tickets.
- [ ] You can book multiple seats according to the cinema and movie choice.
- [ ] The database should be able to distinguish between available seats from the booked ones.
- [ ] The system can look up a reservation# and see which seats were booked.

## Part 1:
- [ ] Construct a clean and concise ER diagram for the OTS database. List your assumptions and clearly indicate the cardinality mappings.

## Part 2:
Write SQL queries OR use a simple Web interface to get the results of the following queries:
- [ ] Enter a city name and retrieve all the movies that are released within that particular city.
- [ ] List all cinemas that are showing a particular movie.
- [ ] List the seats that are booked in all cinemas for a particular movie.
- [ ] Given a specific cinema and movie list the showing times for that movie.
- [ ] Given a movie and session time how many seats are available.
- [ ] Given a reservation# list the cinema, movie session, and time where seats were booked.
- [ ] List the movies with their corresponding time, city, and cinema name.
- [ ] Given a session time list movie title and session times that do not have any seats available.

## What we need to turn in:
- [ ] Which tools were used for the project. (Readme file)
- [ ] ER Diagram
- [ ] Source code of SQL CREATE statements, or screen shots of how you created the tables via one of the tools.
- [ ] Explain which method you used to load the data into the tables.
- [ ] Source code of SQL SELECT statements for each query executed, showing the query result; OR screen shots of your simple Web interface that was used to execute the queries and show the query results
- [ ] Contribution list.
